#pragma once //include this at the top of every header file

//when you actually make a header file, use .hpp file type
//you can have as many declaration statements in a single header file as you want
//never include a source file in a header file, only function definition files
//do not compile header files
//one good rule of thumb when starting a project is to create a header file for every source file you create,
//as the project grows, you may need to assign more header files to a single source file

//forward declaration from source file Day9notes.txt
double convert_F_to_C(double temperature); //this is the declaration of a function
